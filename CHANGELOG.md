## [2025-01-28] - Backend Restructuring for Vercel Deployment

### Summary
Completed comprehensive backend restructuring to enable unified Vercel deployment with serverless functions, replacing the separate Express.js server architecture.

  - Character data (`/api/destiny2/profile/[membershipType]/[membershipId]`)
  - Manifest information (`/api/manifest/info`)
- **Deployment Configuration**: `vercel.json` with routing, CORS, and function settings
- **Environment Documentation**: `.env.example` for deployment variables
- **Unified Architecture**: Single-project structure for frontend and backend

### Changed
- **API Integration**: Updated `bungieAuth.js` to use relative paths (`/api/*`)
