# Guardian Nexus - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

Guardian Nexus is a comprehensive Destiny 2 desktop web application that combines the best features from popular tools like bray.tech, d2armorpicker, and dim.gg. The application aims to provide players with powerful inventory management, loadout optimization, and progress tracking capabilities.

## Recommended Architecture (Based on Industry Analysis)

### Technology Stack: MERN
- **Frontend**: React 18 with modern UI components and Guardian-first design
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for API proxy and business logic
- **Database**: MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas) for flexible game data and user profiles
- **Authentication**: Bungie OAuth 2.0 with secure token management
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Platform (App Engine) for scalability

### Key Design Principles
- **Guardian-First UI**: Center the experience around the player's character
- **Data-Driven**: Leverage comprehensive Bungie.net API integration
- **Community-Focused**: Build social features for sharing and collaboration
- **Performance-Optimized**: Multi-layer caching and efficient data handling

## Technical Insights & Best Practices

### Core Systems Architecture
Based on analysis of successful Destiny 2 companion tools (DIM, light.gg, Braytech), the application should focus on three core systems:

1. **Gear and Inventory Management**
   - Advanced filtering and search capabilities
   - Vault cleaner and organization tools
   - Wish list integration for god rolls
   - Comprehensive gear optimizer

2. **Build Crafting and Optimization**
   - Comprehensive database of items, perks, and stats
   - Advanced stat calculator with mod support
   - God roll finder and recommendations
   - Loadout builder with activity-specific optimization

3. **Community Hub**
   - Build sharing and collaboration features
   - Forums and discussion systems
   - Clan integration and fireteam finder
   - Leaderboards and achievement tracking

### Development Methodology
- **Agile/Kanban**: Use visual workflow management with continuous improvement
- **Just-in-Time (JIT)**: Develop features based on immediate user needs
- **Guardian-Centric Design**: Always prioritize the player experience

### API Integration Strategy
- **Bungie.net API**: Primary data source with OAuth 2.0 authentication
- **Backend Proxy**: Secure API key handling and rate limiting
- **Data Transformation**: Clean and optimize API responses for frontend consumption
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching to reduce API calls and improve performance
